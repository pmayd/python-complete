Instance variables `x` and `y` are created and initialized here. Methods, like functions, are defined by using the `def` keyword. The first argument of any method is **by convention called** `self`. When the method is invoked, `self` is set to **the instance that invoked the method**. Class Circle **inherits** from class Shape and `pi` is similar to, but not exactly like, a standard class variable. A class must, in its initializer, explicitly call the initializer of its base class. The `__str__` method is used by the print function. Other special method attributes permit **operator overloading** or are employed by **built-in** methods such as the length (`len`) function."
