Pig Latin (www.wikihow.com/Speak-Pig-Latin) is a common children’s "secret" language in English-speaking countries. （It’s normally secret among children who forget that their parents were once children themselves.) The rules for translating words from English into Pig Latin are quite simple:

    If the word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), then add way to the end of the word. So air becomes airway and eat becomes eatway.
    If the word begins with any other letter, then we take the first letter, put it on the end of the word, and then add ay. Thus, python becomes ythonpay and computer becomes omputercay.

Bonus:
Consider an alternative version of Pig Latin, in which we don’t check to see if the first letter is a vowel, but rather we check to see if the word contains two different vowels. Thus, "wine" would have "way" added to the end, but "wind" would be translated into "indway". How would you check for two different vowels in the word? (Hint: Sets can come in handy here.)
