# Bite 104. Split and join

Split up the message on newline (\n) using the `split` builtin, then use the `join` builtin to stitch it together using a '|' (pipe).

So `Hello world:\nI am coding in Python :)\nHow awesome!` would turn into: `Hello world:|I am coding in Python :)|How awesome!`

Your code should work for other message strings as well.

Note that as opposed to previous Intro Bites your need to return the new string!

Also note that, although we wanted you to learn about `split` and `join` here, there are more ways to pull this one off (check out the forum upon resolving this Bite ...)
